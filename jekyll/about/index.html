  <p>
  Hello, my name is Christophe and I created this web site to let you follow my trip towards Japan. I'll post stuff as regularly as possible in there, so you can follow my trip to the other side of the world. Hoping that you will enjoy visiting this site as much as I enjoy my trip.

  For people interested in technical details, this site is built with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>.<br/>
  The source code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/ununhexium/rtw">Github</a>.
